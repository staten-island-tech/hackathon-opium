# Markdown Guide for High School Students

Markdown is a lightweight, easy-to-learn language for formatting text. You can use it to create well-structured documents, add styles, and make your writing look great without complex tools. Many popular sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow use Markdown, so learning it can be very helpful!

## 1. **Basic Text Formatting**

### Bold and Italics
- To make text **bold**, put two asterisks (`**`) on each side of the word or phrase:  
  ```
  **Bold Text**
  ```
  Result: **Bold Text**

- To make text *italic*, put one asterisk (`*`) on each side:  
  ```
  *Italic Text*
  ```
  Result: *Italic Text*

- You can combine them for ***bold and italic*** text by using three asterisks (`***`) on each side:  
  ```
  ***Bold and Italic Text***
  ```
  Result: ***Bold and Italic Text***

### Strikethrough
- To cross out text, put two tildes (`~~`) on each side:  
  ```
  ~~Strikethrough~~
  ```
  Result: ~~Strikethrough~~

## 2. **Headers**

Headers make titles and section headings stand out. Markdown has six levels of headers.

- `#` for the largest header (like a title)
- `##` for the next largest
- Continue up to `######` for the smallest header

Example:
```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```
Results in:

# Header 1  
## Header 2  
### Header 3

## 3. **Lists**

### Bulleted Lists
Use `*`, `-`, or `+` for each bullet point:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```
Result:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

### Numbered Lists
For ordered lists, use numbers:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```
Result:

1. First item  
2. Second item  
3. Third item

## 4. **Links and Images**

### Links
To add a link, use `[text](URL)`:

```markdown
[Visit Google](https://www.google.com)
```
Result: [Visit Google](https://www.google.com)

### Images
To add an image, use `![alt text](URL)`. The alt text describes the image if it doesnâ€™t load.

```markdown
![Sample Image](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```
This will show an image if you replace the URL with a real one.

## 5. **Code Blocks**

To show code in your document, use backticks:

- **Inline code**: Wrap code with one backtick (`):  
  ```
  `code here`
  ```
  Result: `code here`

- **Code Blocks**: For multiple lines, use three backticks (```) at the beginning and end:

  ```markdown
  ```
  def hello():
      print("Hello, world!")
  ```
  ```

Result:
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

---

## 6. **Blockquotes**

To highlight text as a quote, use `>` at the beginning of the line:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```
Result:

> This is a blockquote.

---

## 7. **Horizontal Lines**

To create a horizontal line (divider), use three or more dashes (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`):

```markdown
---
```
Result:

---

## 8. **Tables**

Tables help organize information neatly. Separate column headers with `|` and use `-` for the header row.

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | More Data|
```

Result:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | More Data|
